				"A stationary Mechanical Drill will break blocks in the block in front of it with a time in seconds of (45 x Hardness)/RPM and will hurt entities in an area around it."
				""
				"A Mechanical Drill moved by components such as a Mechanical Bearing or Mechanical Piston will break blocks and damage entities with which it collides. Mechanical Drills moving as such, or those part of a larger contraption through the use of Chassis or Super Glue do not need to receive a rotational force to mine, and instead break blocks at a constant rate when in contact with said block. The entire construction the Mechanical Drill is placed on will freeze in place (and remain an entity) while the Mechanical Drill digs the block; for example, a Mechanical Drill will pause the extension of a Mechanical Piston when it drills a block, and the extension will resume once the block is broken. The time it takes for a Mechanical Drill to break a block is based on the block's Hardness value."
